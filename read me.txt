For tabular time-series, SMOTE IS NOT suitable

SMOTE works on independent tabular rows.

But you have ordered sequences (TCN)
→ SMOTE would destroy the temporal structure.
→ You cannot oversample individual rows without breaking sequences.

So we need sequence-aware augmentation + proper sampling.
